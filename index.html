                    This is the first installment of a series that will go through all periods of Folliccanese History. This one focuses on the Mystic Period (so-called
                    because of the lack of records from this time), lasting from the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century to the 3ʳᵈ Follicle Century (around 2600 BCE Human Time). It is
                    important to note that time passes very differently in the Follicle Realm compared to the Human Realm. Conversion between the two times is hard for
                    historical works as Folliccanese disinterest in the Human Realm meant that conversions were historically not written down. Not only that, the conversion
                    has been known to fluctuate frequently. This makes historical conversions practically impossible. Nevertheless, these dates are still useful as they
                    provide context to events and how the Follicles may have perceived them.

                    Our first subject is the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century, dubbed the Missing Century due to the absence of records from this time. Thanks to the Works of unknown
                    authors in the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ Centuries, we know quite a bit about how life worked in the Missing Century. According to these Texts, the 10 Follicle Families
                    divided the Follicle Fjords between them so that each of them would have ample room to grow crops, develop, and do other things. These divisions developed
                    into the 10 Historic Regions of the Follicle Fjords, many of which Still contain a majority Tribe.

                    Early Follicle society was mainly Agrarian and Isolationist. Many Follicles did not venture out into the world since the First Follicles — the Wisest and most
                    Respected Follicles — looked over the Whole World and chose the Follicle Fjords as their Home. They wouldn't Dare go against the Decisions of their Forefathers.
                    This stationary attitude allowed the Follicles to perfect their Powers. Archaeological evidence suggests that these early Follicles used Glyphs to channel
                    their Powers. Whether these were transcriptions of their language or purely Magical is still up for debate. If these Glyphs do represent a Language, they would be
                    our Only Records of Proto-Folliccanese, the language of the 1ˢᵗ Century.

                    Coming into the 2ⁿᵈ Century, a Cultural Shift occurs causing a Desire to Explore and Settle New lands. Over the span of around 30 years, Follicles Spread out
                    along the Pink Coast. Unlike later Migrations, Tribes seemed to have Migrated in Equal numbers, resulting in Diverse settlements along the Pink Coast. Fear
                    of What Lay in the coastal Forests prevented most Follicles from venturing Inland, as that would require Passing through Them. However, some Did establish
                    Settlements in the Inland Prairies, notably those from the 1ˢᵗ and 8ᵗʰ Follicle Tribes, whose families had been Known for their Bravery and Recklessness.

                    With Settlements being established Up and Down the Coast, Trade was inevitable. Trade networks along the Pink Coast were Bustling by 216, though trade was
                    established Much Earlier, perhaps as early as 206. Trade to the inland settlements was much Sparser due to the Fear of the Forests. With trade came a
                    need to keep Track of Trade: Writing. The earliest Writings come from around 210, most of which were Logs of Products coming in and out the Pink Bay,
                    one of the most Populous Pink Coast settlements of the time.

                    An Increase in writing occurred in the 3ʳᵈ Century with the establishment of Political Entities and Governments. Most Polities (political entities)
                    were city-states, but Some, such as the settlement at Pink Bay, expanded Beyond their walls and Influenced a (relatively) Large area. Pink Bay was able to
                    do this due to the Large Sums of Money trade brought them. Despite being the Folliccanese Homeland, the Follicle Fjords actually had Less Influence than
                    Pink Bay. Nevertheless, it was still a Valued Homeland for the Pink Coast Follicles. This era also saw the Rise of Regional identities along the Pink
                    Coast and in the Inland Prairies. This coincided with the development of many Distinct Dialects of Pre-Classical Folliccanese — the Language of the 2ⁿᵈ
                    and 3ʳᵈ Centuries — in these regions. Trends in the few written records we Do have suggest that the Pink Bay Dialect was the standard in literary tradition
                    and governance.

            <p>
                <b>
                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese evolved out of Proto-Folliccanese. We have barely any idea as to what Proto-Folliccanese was like. All we know is that it had an
                    SOV word order, two grammatical genders (animate and inanimate), had no noun cases, and was head-final. there is one piece of evidence — the Follicle Saga — that
                    suggests that nasal consonants could take the place of vowels. Notably, the name Nãmnʳ appears in it, where nʳ — a rhinal trill — acts as a vowel. Proto-Folliccanese
                    also evolved extremely quickly into Pre-Classical Folliccanese by linguistic standards, only taking 100 years to do so. No one knows how this happened, but there
                    is a fringe theory that states that Proto-Folliccanese was never spoken, and instead Pre-Classical Folliccanese was designed by the First Follicles. However, only
                    the most insane of insane believe this theory.

                <b>
                    Our small but sizeable corpus of material has allowed us to get an idea of what Pre-Classical Folliccanese was like. It also helps that the Prairie Languages diverged
                    from the rest of the Folliccanese languages in the 3ʳᵈ Century. This means that comparative analysis (comparing languages' grammar and vocabulary to see
                    how they're related) can be used to fill in the gaps.

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese had a fairly simple consonant inventory that consisted of only voiceless stops and fricatives, as well as nasals and a rhinal trill, a
                    sound produced when a follicle blows air through their nose in such a way that it flaps up and down. Note that all characters in parentheses are used to represent
                    that sound in the romanization system used here but not in the IPA.

                    Allophonic variation with these consonants' voiced counterparts probably existed, but it is unknown in what environments these allophones occurred. In all
                    likely-hood, the voiced counterparts probably occurred between vowels (this might have even occurred between words). If that is the case, it would be more accurate that the voiceless consonants were
                    allophones of the voiced consonants. The voiceless stops (plosives) and fricatives are shown as that is how they have been historically analyzed.

                    In contrast, to the language's consonant inventory, its vowel inventory was quite complex. There were three series of vowels: neutral, nasal, and screamed. The main
                    distinction from neutral and screamed vowels is that screamed vowels were produced in the "head voice", giving them a different quality compared to the neutral vowels.
                    They get their name from how they are used in casual conversation, where they were produced at a higher volume. However, if follicles needed to talk quietly, they would
                    change the color of the vowels but not the vowels' volumes. Not all vowels could be nasal or screamed, only certain vowels could.

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese had CV syllable structure, meaning that every syllable had to begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. This might not seem the case
                    when we romanize words like <i>ynãfanæ</i>, meaning woman, as there appears to be no consonant before y. However, when we romanize Pre-Classical Folliccanese, we omit the glottal stop (ʔ)
                    — the apostrophes in bo'o'o wa'er — as it always and only appears in the first syllable of a word that begins with a vowel. There is an exception to this, however,
                    since if a word begins with /u/, a /w/ would be placed in front of it instead of the glottal stop. This is why we analyze w as a semivowel.

                    Glottal stops could not occur in syllables that were not the first syllable of a word, so a word like <i>wana'a'a</i> (the apostrophes here represent glottal stops)
                    could not exist in Pre-Classical Folliccanese. Vowel placement was not free, at least for non-neutral vowels. Neutral vowels could go in any syllable, but nasal vowels
                    could only go after nasal consonants (n and m), and screamed vowels could only go after laryngeal fricatives (x and h).

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese was probably a syllable-timed languages, meaning that each syllable took around the same amount of time to say.
                    Compare that to English where stressed syllables are lengthened. Pre-Classical Folliccanese marked lexical stress with pitch-accent (a stress-marking
                    system in which some syllables have a different pitch than others, in this case, stressed syllables are marked with a high tone). 
                    Pitch-accent is not to be confused with tonality, as high or neutral pitch does not necessarily change a word's meaning as it does
                    in tonal languages. Changing where that pitch-accent is placed can however change the meaning of a word. Lexical stress in Pre-Classical Folliccanese always
                    falls on the first syllable, except if a syllable has a screamed vowel, then the first screamed vowel is stressed. When a screamed vowel is stressed, it is
                    pronounced at a higher pitch than usual, but when it is not stressed, it is still pronounced at a screamed vowel's distinctively high pitch.

                    Prosodic stress, weirdly enough, was probably marked by lengthening a the last syllable of a word. These ways of marking lexical and prosodic stress gave
                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese gave it a distinctively musical quality. Many Mystic Period writers have described it as song-like and musical.

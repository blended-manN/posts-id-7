                    This is the first installment of a series that will go through all periods of Folliccanese History. This one focuses on the Mystic Period (so-called
                    because of the lack of records from this time), lasting from the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century to the 3ʳᵈ Follicle Century (around 2600 BCE Human Time). It is
                    important to note that time passes very differently in the Follicle Realm compared to the Human Realm. Conversion between the two times is hard for
                    historical works as Folliccanese disinterest in the Human Realm meant that conversions were historically not written down. Not only that, the conversion
                    has been known to fluctuate frequently. This makes historical conversions practically impossible. Nevertheless, these dates are still useful as they
                    provide context to events and how the Follicles may have perceived them.

                    Our first subject is the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century, dubbed the Missing Century due to the absence of records from this time. Thanks to the works of unknown
                    authors in the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ Centuries, we know quite a bit about how life worked in the Missing Century. According to these texts, the 10 Follicle Families
                    divided the Follicle Fjords between them so that each of them would have ample room to grow crops, develop, and do other things. These divisions developed
                    into the 10 Historic Regions of the Follicle Fjords, many of which still contain a majority tribe.

                    Early Follicle society was mainly agrarian and isolationist. Many Follicles did not venture out into the world since the First Follicles — the wisest and most
                    respected follicles — looked over the whole world and chose the Follicle Fjords as their Home. They wouldn't dare go against the decisions of their forefathers.
                    This stationary attitude allowed the Follicles to perfect their powers. Archaeological evidence suggests that these early Follicles used glyphs to channel
                    their powers. Whether these were transcriptions of their language or purely magical is still up for debate. If these glyphs do represent a language, they would be
                    our only records of Proto-Folliccanese, the language of the 1ˢᵗ Century.

                <strong>
                    Coming into the 2ⁿᵈ Century, a cultural shift occurs causing a desire to explore and settle new lands. Over the span of around 30 years, Follicles spread out
                    along the Pink Coast. Unlike later migrations, Tribes seemed to have migrated in equal numbers, resulting in diverse settlements along the Pink Coast. Fear
                    of what lay in the coastal forests prevented most Follicles from venturing inland. However, some did establish
                    settlements in the inland Prairies, notably those from the 1ˢᵗ and 8ᵗʰ Follicle Tribes, whose families had been known for their bravery and recklessness.

                <strong>
                    With settlements being established up and down the coast, trade was inevitable. Trade networks along the Pink Coast were bustling by 216, though trade was
                    established much earlier, perhaps as early as 204. Trade to the inland settlements was much sparser due to the fear of the forests. With trade came a
                    need to keep track of trade: writing. The earliest writings come from around 210, most of which were logs of products coming in and out of the Pink Bay,
                    one of the most Populous Pink Coast settlements of the time.

                    Around 246, one of the most famous written works was created: the Follicle Saga. In its full form, it would have detailed the creation of the world
                    and the actions of the different Follicle Tribes. Sadly, most of this saga has been lost to time, but a few parts survive, notably the creation of the world and
                    the Story of the First Follicles.

                    An increase in writing occurred in the 3ʳᵈ Century with the establishment of political entities and governments. Most polities (political entities)
                    were city-states, but some, such as the settlement at Pink Bay, expanded beyond their walls and influenced a (relatively) large area. Pink Bay was able to
                    do this due to the large sums of money trade brought them. Despite being the Folliccanese Homeland, the Follicle Fjords actually had less influence than
                    Pink Bay. Nevertheless, it was still a valued homeland for the Pink Coast Follicles. This era also saw the rise of regional identities along the Pink
                    Coast and in the inland Prairies. This coincided with the development of many distinct dialects of Pre-Classical Folliccanese — the Language of the 2ⁿᵈ
                    and 3ʳᵈ Centuries — in these regions. Trends in the few written records we have suggest that the Pink Bay Dialect was the standard in literary tradition
                    and governance.

                <b>
                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese evolved into its written form around the 2ⁿᵈ Century out of the language of the 1ˢᵗ Century, Proto-Folliccanese. Not much is known about
                    Proto-Folliccanese, however it likely had a basic word order known as SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This word order was preserved in Pre-Classical Folliccanese as it became
                    the default word order. The phonology (sounds of a language) of Proto-Folliccanese was probably very similar to that of Pre-Classical Folliccanese. However, its
                    phonotactics (the rules for how sounds can be combined in a language) might have been looser than Pre-Classical Folliccanese, as the Follicle Chronicles mentions
                    one name, Nãmnʳ, that violates Pre-Classical Folliccanese's phontactics. This name has been analyzed in three ways. The first being that <i>nʳ</i>, a rhinal trill (a sound
                    produced by a follicle blowing air through their nose in such a way that it flaps up and down), is functioning as a vowel, which is consistent with many other names within
                    the saga and Pre-Classical Folliccanese, as both have syllables composed of one consonant and one vowel (CV syllable structure). The second way this has been analyzed is that
                    <i>mnʳ</i> forms a consonant cluster, indicating that Proto-Folliccanese could have syllable-final consonants, something that is absent in both Pre-Classical Folliccanese and
                    every other name in the Follicle Saga. The third and least popular analysis is that it is a mistake by the author. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that Proto-Folliccanese
                    was very different from Pre-Classical Folliccanese

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese had a fairly simple consonant inventory. All of its stops (sounds produced by completely blocking air flow) and fricatives (sounds produced
                    by nearly blocking air flow to create a hissing or buzzing sound such as the English /s/) were voiceless (produced without the vocal chords vibrating), at least that is how
                    they are classically analyzed.

                    While the stops and fricatives have been classically analyzed as voiceless, it is unlikely that they were voiceless in all contexts. As suggested by Prairie Folliccanese
                    and Classical Folliccanese having voiced stops and fricatives most commonly between vowels, Pre-Classical Folliccanese likely had allophonic variation (allophones are sounds
                    that can replace other sounds while still not changing the meaning of the word, i.e. I could replace the /t/ in water with /ʔ/ to get wa'er and the meaning would not change) with
                    voiced consonants and fricatives between vowels. This was almost definitely the case in the late 3ʳᵈ Century when Pre-Classical Folliccanese was evolving into Prairie and
                    Classical Folliccanese.

            <p>
                <b>
                    In contrast, to the language's consonant inventory, its vowel inventory was quite complex. There were three series of vowels: neutral, nasal, and screamed. Nasal vowels
                    differed from neutral vowels in that they are produced by letting some air through the nose. The main
                    distinction from neutral and screamed vowels is that screamed vowels were produced in the "head voice", giving them a different quality compared to the neutral vowels.
                    They get their name from how they are used in casual conversation, where they were produced at a higher volume. However, if follicles needed to talk quietly, they would
                    change the color of the vowels but not the vowels' volumes. Not all vowels could be nasal or screamed, only certain vowels could.

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese had CV syllable structure, meaning that every syllable had to begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. This might not seem the case
                    when we romanize words like <i>ynãfanæ</i>, meaning woman, as there appears to be no consonant before y. However, when we romanize Pre-Classical Folliccanese, we omit the glottal stop (ʔ)
                    — the apostrophes in bo'o'o wa'er — as it always and only appears in the first syllable of a word that begins with a vowel. There is an exception to this, however,
                    since if a word begins with /u/, a /w/ would be placed in front of it instead of the glottal stop. This is why we analyze w as a semivowel.

                    Glottal stops could not occur in syllables that were not the first syllable of a word, so a word like <i>wana'a'a</i> (the apostrophes here represent glottal stops)
                    could not exist in Pre-Classical Folliccanese. Vowel placement was not free, at least for non-neutral vowels. Neutral vowels could go in any syllable, but nasal vowels
                    could only go after nasal consonants (n and m), and screamed vowels could only go after laryngeal fricatives (x and h).

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese was probably a syllable-timed languages, meaning that each syllable took around the same amount of time to say.
                    Compare that to English where stressed syllables are lengthened. Pre-Classical Folliccanese marked lexical stress with pitch-accent (a stress-marking
                    system in which some syllables have a different pitch than others, in this case, stressed syllables are marked with a high tone). 
                    Pitch-accent is not to be confused with tonality, as high or neutral pitch does not necessarily change a word's meaning as it does
                    in tonal languages. Changing where that pitch-accent is placed can however change the meaning of a word. Lexical stress in Pre-Classical Folliccanese always
                    falls on the first syllable, except if a syllable has a screamed vowel, then the first screamed vowel is stressed. When a screamed vowel is stressed, it is
                    pronounced at a higher pitch than usual, but when it is not stressed, it is still pronounced at a screamed vowel's distinctively high pitch.

                    Prosodic stress, weirdly enough, was probably marked by lengthening a the stressed syllable of a word. These ways of marking lexical and prosodic stress gave
                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese gave it a distinctive rhythmic quality.

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese's grammar was synthetic, meaning that word parts can be added on to show different grammatical meanings. It was inflectional

                    meaning, but it did not have totally free word order. The default word order was SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), so a sentence such as "I eat beef" would be

                    would be grammatically correct and understood by a Pre-Classical Folliccanese speaker. SOV word order, however, had to be used in relative clauses, which modify a noun phrase
                    with some kind of relativity (e.g. The people WHO were talking were bad), and yes-no questions. Though most combinations of words could be placed anywhere within
                    a clause or phrase in any order because of the amount of inflection, there were set orders for some parts of speech. Adverbs had to go before the verbs they modified
                    (e.g. quickly ran not ran quickly), nouns came before determiners (articles and numbers, e.g. book the not the book, and books two, not two books), and possessors
                    came before the things they possessed (e.g. John's house not house John's).

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese had six noun cases that combined with four grammatical genders to represent various grammatical constructions. Not all nouns could take each gender
                    as only sapient nouns (such as doctor, magician, woman, man) could take the masculine or feminine genders, while all other nouns had to take either the animate or inanimate genders.
                    Sapient nouns could take the animate gender if they described groups of both men and women, or the gender of the follicle was unknown (e.g. doctor for hire, doctor would be in the
                    animate gender because the employer does not know whether or not a male or a female would be hired for the role)
                    Noun and adjective declension would go as

                    Now what do all of these fancy cases do? The nominative case marks the subject of a clause, the accusative marks the direct object (the noun that receives the object
                    e.g. I kicked the <i>ball</i>), the genitive marks possession (e.g. <i>John's</i> dog), the dative marks the indirect object of a clause (the recipient of the
                    direct object or the beneficiary of the verb, e.g. I gave the book to <i>him</i>), the adpositional marks the object of an adposition (e.g. on the <i>chair</i>),
                    and the instrumental marks a noun that was used to perform something (e.g. I hit it with a <i>hammer</i>).

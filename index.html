                    This is the first installment of a series that will go through all periods of Folliccanese History. This one focuses on the Mystic Period (so-called
                    because of the lack of records from this time), lasting from the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century to the 3ʳᵈ Follicle Century (around 2600 BCE Human Time). It is
                    important to note that time passes very differently in the Follicle Realm compared to the Human Realm. Conversion between the two times is hard for
                    historical works as Folliccanese disinterest in the Human Realm meant that conversions were historically not written down. Not only that, the conversion
                    has been known to fluctuate frequently. This makes historical conversions practically impossible. Nevertheless, these dates are still useful as they
                    provide context to events and how the Follicles may have perceived them.

                    Our first subject is the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century, dubbed the Missing Century due to the absence of records from this time. Thanks to the Works of unknown
                    authors in the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ Centuries, we know quite a bit about how life worked in the Missing Century. According to these Texts, the 10 Follicle Families
                    divided the Follicle Fjords between them so that each of them would have ample room to grow crops, develop, and do other things. These divisions developed
                    into the 10 Historic Regions of the Follicle Fjords, many of which Still contain a majority Tribe.

                    Early Follicle society was mainly Agrarian and Isolationist. Many Follicles did not venture out into the world since the First Follicles — the Wisest and most
                    Respected Follicles — looked over the Whole World and chose the Follicle Fjords as their Home. They wouldn't Dare go against the Decisions of their Forefathers.
                    This stationary attitude allowed the Follicles to perfect their Powers. Archaeological evidence suggests that these early Follicles used Glyphs to channel
                    their Powers. Whether these were transciprions of their language or purely Magical is still up for debate. If these Glyphs do represent a Language, they would be
                    our Only Records of Proto-Folliccanese, the language of the 1ˢᵗ Century.

                    This is the first installment of a series that will go through all periods of Folliccanese History. This one focuses on the Mystic Period (so-called
                    because of the lack of records from this time), lasting from the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century to the 3ʳᵈ Follicle Century (around 2600 BCE Human Time). It is
                    important to note that time passes very differently in the Follicle Realm compared to the Human Realm. Conversion between the two times is hard for
                    historical works as Folliccanese disinterest in the Human Realm meant that conversions were historically not written down. Not only that, the conversion
                    has been known to fluctuate frequently. This makes historical conversions practically impossible. Nevertheless, these dates are still useful as they
                    provide context to events and how the Follicles may have perceived them.

                    Our first subject is the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century, dubbed the Missing Century due to the absence of records from this time. Thanks to the Works of unknown
                    authors in the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ Centuries, we know quite a bit about how life worked in the Missing Century. According to these Texts, the 10 Follicle Families
                    divided the Follicle Fjords between them so that each of them would have ample room to grow crops, develop, and do other things. These divisions developed
                    into the 10 Historic Regions of the Follicle Fjords, many of which Still contain a majority Tribe.

                    Early Follicle society was mainly Agrarian and Isolationist. Many Follicles did not venture out into the world since the First Follicles — the Wisest and most
                    Respected Follicles — looked over the Whole World and chose the Follicle Fjords as their Home. They wouldn't Dare go against the Decisions of their Forefathers.
                    This stationary attitude allowed the Follicles to perfect their Powers. Archaeological evidence suggests that these early Follicles used Glyphs to channel
                    their Powers. Whether these were transciprions of their language or purely Magical is still up for debate. If these Glyphs do represent a Language, they would be
                    our Only Records of Proto-Folliccanese, the language of the 1ˢᵗ Century.

                    Coming into the 2ⁿᵈ Century, a Cultural Shift occurs causing a Desire to Explore and Settle New lands. Over the span of around 30 years, Follicles Spread out
                    along the Pink Coast. Unlike later Migrations, Tribes seemed to have Migrated in Equal numbers, resulting in Diverse settlements along the Pink Coast. Fear
                    of What Lay in the coastal Forests prevented most Follicles from venturing Inland, as that would require Passing through Them. However, some Did establish
                    Settlements in the Inland Prairies, notably those from the 1ˢᵗ and 8ᵗʰ Follicle Tribes, whose families had been Known for their Bravery and Recklessness.

                    With Settlements being established Up and Down the Coast, Trade was inevitable. Trade networks along the Pink Coast were Bustling by 216, though trade was
                    established Much Earlier, perhaps as early as 206. Trade to the inland settlements was much Sparser due to the Fear of the Forests. With trade came a
                    need to keep Track of Trade: Writing. The earliest Writings come from around 210, most of which were Logs of Products coming in and out the Pink Bay,
                    one of the most Populous Pink Coast settlements of the time.

                    Around 246, one of the most famous Written Works was created: the Follicle Saga. In its full form, it would have Detailed the Creation of the World
                    and the actions of the different Follicle Tribes. Sadly, most of this saga has been Lost to Time, but a few parts Survive, notably the Creation of the World and
                    the Story of the First Follicles.

                    An Increase in writing occured in the 3ʳᵈ Century with the establishment of Political Entites and Governments. Most Polities (political entities)
                    were city-states, but Some, such as the settlement at Pink Bay, expanded Beyond their walls and Influenced a (relatively) Large area. Pink Bay was able to
                    do this due to the Large Sums of Money trade brought them. Despite being the Folliccanese Homeland, the Follicle Fjords actually had Less Influence than
                    Pink Bay. Nevertheless, it was still a Valued Homeland for the Pink Coast Follicles. This era also saw the Rise of Regional identities along the Pink
                    Coast and in the Inland Praries. This coincided with the devleopment of many Distinct Dialects of Pre-Classical Folliccanese — the Language of the 2ⁿᵈ
                    and 3ʳᵈ Centuries — in these regions. Trends in the few written records we Do have suggest that the Pink Bay Dialect was the standard in literary tradition
                    and governance.

                <b>
                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese evolved out of Proto-Folliccanese. We have barely any idea as to what Proto-Folliccanese was like. All we know is that it had an
                    SOV word order, two grammatical genders (animate and inanimate), had no noun cases, and was head-final. there is one piece of evidence — the Follicle Saga — that
                    suggests that nasal consonants could take the place of vowels. Notably, the name Nãmnʳ appears in it, where nʳ — a rhinal trill — acts as a vowel. Proto-Folliccanese
                    also evolved extremely quickly into Pre-Classical Foliccanese by linguistic standards, only taking 100 years to do so. No one knows how this happenned, but there
                    is a fringe theory that states that Proto-Folliccanese was never spoken, and instead Pre-Classical Folliccanese was designed by the First Follicles. However, only
                    the most insane of insane believe this theory.

                    Our small bu sizeable corpus of material has allowed us to get an idea of what Pre-Classical Folliccanese was like. It also helps that the Prairie Languages diverged
                    from the rest of the Folliccanese languages in the 3ʳᵈ Century. This means that comparative analysis (comparing languages' grammar and vocabulary to see
                    how they're related) can be used to fill in the gaps.

                    Pre-Classical Folliccanese had a farily simple consonant inventory that consisted of only voiceless stops and fricatives, as well as nasals and a rhinal trill, a
                    sound produced when a follicle blows air through their nose in such a way that it flaps up and down.

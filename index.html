                <b>
                    This is the first installment of a series that will go through all periods of Folliccanese History. This one focuses on the Mystic Period (so-called
                    because of the lack of records from this time), lasting from the 1ˢᵗ Follicle Century to the 3ʳᵈ Follicle Century (around 2600 BCE Human Time). It is
                    important to note that time passes very differently in the Follicle Realm compared to the Human Realm. Conversion between the two times is hard for
                    historical works as Folliccanese disinterest in the Human Realm meant that conversions were historically not written down. Not only that, the conversion
                    has been known to fluctuate frequently. This makes historical conversions practically impossible. Nevertheless, these dates are still useful as they
                    provide context to events and how the Follicles may have perceived them.
